ICE Training Duration Data (2003-2026)

This dataset was complied using Google Searches and ChatGPT Deep Research to locate historic ICE training manuals, news articles, and other sources to identify the length of training received by new ICE agents since the agency's creation in 2003.

NOTE: This dataset is incomplete. Data before 2007 could not be located, and while I believe we can assume that there were no major changes to ICE training durations in between data points, I cannot say for certain.
